A voxel engine made by someone crazy enough to do it from scratch

# The Crazy Roadmap
- Learn the basics of computer graphics:
  - Become familiar with fundamental concepts like vertices, polygons, shaders, rendering pipelines
- Start with WebGL using TypeScript
  - Use beginner-friendly WebGL framework like Three.js or Babylon.js
  - Learn basic WebGL ([MDN's WebGL tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API#guides_and_tutorials)), including creating a scene, rendering basic shapes, applying textures
- Handle user input and interactions in WebGL
  - Learn how to capture user input events, like mouse and keyboard interactions
  - Implement functionality for user interactions, such as placing or removing objects in scene
- Implement voxel data representation in WebGL
  - Store voxel data efficiently, in a 3D array or octree
  - Populate and manipulate voxel data in WebGL environment
- Generate and render voxel terrain
  - Implement simple voxel terrain generation algorithm, such as heightmap-based or procedural noise
  - Render generated voxel terrain
- Optimize and improve performance
  - Identify performance bottlenecks through profiling and optimize critical sections if needed
  - Consider techniques like level of detail (LOD) rendering or frustum culling to improve rendering performance
- Transition to OpenGL with C++
  - Setup dev environment for C++ and OpenGL libraries
- Port WebGL code to OpenGL with C++
  - Understand differences between WebGL and OpenGL, such as API calls and shader syntax
- Refactor and optimize C++ codebase
  - Leverage advantages of C++ and optimize performance
  - Consider low-level optimizations, memory management, and other techniques specific to C++ and OpenGL
- Expand features and polish in OpenGL and C++
  - Add additional features to voxel engine, such as lighting, shadows or advanced physics simulation
  - Polish user interface, improve visual appeal, refine overall user experience
